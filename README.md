## MAGD 150

In this file are the links to my 5 projects as well as brief descriptions following the links.

### [Project 1](https://github.com/MatuszakJacobS/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Project%203.pde)

For this Project, which was actually the third project assigned to us in class, we were supposed to create a program that use several math operators, comparisons and functions among other things. The theme of this project was bubbles, so I decided to make a game where the objective was to pop bubbles in a cave before they reached the ceiling. The bubbles moved back and forth as they floated upwards, and if they hit the top they would cause stalagtites to fall down and break the player's pin.

### [Project 2](https://github.com/MatuszakJacobS/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Project%204.pde)

For the second Project, which was the fourth project in class, we were supposed to create an animation that changed based on user input, with the theme bouncy balls. I decided to make a box which was initially empty, where the user can hold down the mouse create create a ball. The new ball would increase in size the longer it was held, and would start bouncing around the screen after the mouse is let go. If the user pressed right mouse, then the balls would begin to collide and bounce off each other, and pressing any key on the keyboard would rapidly change every balls' colors.

### [Project 3](https://github.com/MatuszakJacobS/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Project%205.pde)

For the next Project, which was the fifth project in class, we were supposed to create a program that had different kinds of buttons that could be interacted with by the mouse, following a theme of menus to an alternate dimension. What I decided to do was create a pattern matching game. The objective was to make a grid of 10x10 squares that can be turned on or off like lights to match 3 different patterns along the top of the screen. If all 3 patterns were met, then the board would split apart and fade off screen, at which point an eye would open up from the center of the screen, always looking at where the mouse is.

### [Project 4](https://github.com/MatuszakJacobS/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Project%206.pde)

For the next Project, which was the sixth project in class, we were supposed to create separate user-defined classes and functions to make a screensaver of some sort. I decided to create a large array of different colored ball objects that would follow a line moving away from the screen in a random direction. However, the balls wouldn't follow this line directly, and rather would spiral around the line as they moved away from the center of the screen, giving a nice swirl effect on the screen.

### [Project 5](https://github.com/MatuszakJacobS/MAGD-150-Assignments/blob/master/Project%207.pde)

For the last Project, which was the seventh project in class, we were supposed to use vector functions and arrays for some transformations in a nature theme. What I decided to do was create a landscape with a tree on it that is manipulated by the user. The user can move a slider inside of a box to changed what time of day it is, as well as what time of year it is. Therefore, the farther the player moved this slider, it would lose or gain leaves, as well have snow appear on the ground or change the color of the grass.
